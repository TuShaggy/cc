# Draconic Reactor Monitor for CC: Tweaked

This project is a ComputerCraft script for monitoring and controlling a Draconic Evolution reactor. It provides a detailed overview on an attached monitor, including temperature, energy saturation, field strength, and fuel levels, along with some automated safety features.

This version is a refactored and consolidated script based on the work of others in the community.

## Installation

1.  Place all project files (`install`, `startup.lua`, `README.md`, etc.) into the root directory of the target ComputerCraft computer. You can find this folder in your Minecraft world save, for example: `.minecraft/saves/<world_name>/computer/<computer_id>/`.
2.  On the ComputerCraft computer, run the installer:
    ```
    install
    ```
3.  The installer will copy the necessary files to their final destinations.
4.  Reboot the computer by holding `Ctrl+R`. The monitor script should start automatically.
